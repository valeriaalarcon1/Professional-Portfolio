                    dancer and is currently in a professional salsa company in New York. Although her life may seem too occupied for more, Valeria
                    is determined to build multiple assets and pursue many more of her passions and goals. Her ambition has recently led her to
                    take on a new experience of becoming a software developer. As a student in Columbia University's Coding Bootcamp, she strives
                    to become an innovate designer and developer that will attain the knowledge to build her own software company one day.</p>
