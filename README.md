# Professional-Portfolio
Module 2 Challenge

## What is it?
This Professional Portfolio is a portfolio designed by and for Valeria Alarcon. As a coding student, she is eager to practice using what she's learned so far to start a portfolio for the work she's doing and will be doing as a programmer. Although there's not much to show yet, she loves the ability to use the skills she has learned so far to build even the simplest applications. With this challenge, she can begin to see how far she'll be able to go one day. 

## How was it made?
This portfolio was made using HTML and CSS.

## What will you find?
In this portfolio, you will see a header, a navigation bar with titles that, when you click on, scrolls to the corresponding section on the page, a layout that separates the section titles to the left and the information on the right, an about section with a description of Valeria, a work section with examples of her work--the first example should appear to be bigger than the other examples on the page--, a contact section with linked contact information, and a footer.
